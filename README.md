The methodology for the "NextGen College Advisor" project involves a seamless integration of user interaction and machine learning to predict college admission chances. The process begins with students signing up on the platform using their application number and hall ticket number, which helps create a personalized profile. After logging in, students input critical details such as their rank and desired branch of study. This information feeds into a machine learning model, specifically a linear regression algorithm, which has been trained on data from the past five years of general merit cutoffs across various colleges. The model processes the input data to predict the likelihood of admission to different colleges. This information is vital as it serves as the primary input for the machine learning model. The system then applies a linear regression algorithm that has been meticulously trained on the past five years of general merit cutoffs from a wide range of colleges. This historical data allows the model to make accurate predictions by identifying trends and patterns that influence admission chances. Finally, the system displays a list of colleges along with their predicted cutoffs and the probability of securing a seat, enabling students to make informed decisions and streamline their application process.
